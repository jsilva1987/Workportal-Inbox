**iOS Coding Test - Bizagi**

## Introduction

Greetings and thank you for taking the time to check my Coding Test attempt.

My approach was minimalistic, I incorporated Bizagi's color scheme while relying on the UIKit native framework. I opted not to bother with third-party frameworks, and instead used a "tap to reveal" approach, insipired by the way the Android notifications work - this allows the user to have immediate control over the actions to execute without missing on the rest of information presented.

I also used the MVVM architecture type to display the cells; however, since they ViewModel and Model itself ended up sharing so much information, I decided to only rely on the Model for the approach.

## Running the project  

The project was build on Xcode 8.3.3, and like mentioned before, it does not rely on third-party frameworks. It should run fine on any Simulator, but please let me know otherwise. Tested on iOS 10.3.
